# tl-pax8

This is a Python library for the Pax8 API that is autogenerated from Pax8's OpenAPI spec using [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

## Repo guidelines
We will inevitably need to make changes to the generated library to add functionality or fix bugs. Please follow these steps to ensure we can track changes on top of the generated code.

1. Always start a client library repo with the unmodified generated code.
2. Changes to the generated code should be made in later commits.
3. Make sure to bump the version of the library in the `pyproject.toml` file. We will use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Generating the library
1. Start by initializing an empty python package with `uv`.
```bash
uv init --package --no-readme 
``` 
2. Download the Authentication and Partner endpoint open api specs from [here](https://devx.pax8.com/openapi), and put them in [spec/authentication.pax8.json](spec/authentication.pax8.json) and [spec/partner-endpoints.pax8.json](spec/partner-endpoints.pax8.json) respectively.
3. Merge the two specs into a single file:
```bash
# from the devcontainer
openapi-merge-cli -c spec/merge.config.json
```
4. Run the following command to generate the library:

```bash
# from the devcontainer
openapi-generator-cli generate -c spec/config.yaml
```
